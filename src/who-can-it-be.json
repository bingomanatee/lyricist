  "lyrics": "Who can it be knocking at my door?\nGo 'way, don't come 'round here no more.\nCan't you see that it's late at night?\nI'm very tired, and I'm not feeling right.\nAll I wish is to be alone\nStay away, don't you invade my home.\nBest off if you hang outside\nDon't come in - I'll only run and hide.\n\nWho can it be now?\nWho can it be now?\nWho can it be now?\nWho can it be now?\n\nWho can it be knocking at my door?\nMake no sound, tip-toe across the floor.\nIf he hears, he'll knock all day\nI'll be trapped, and here I'll have to stay.\nI've done no harm, I keep to myself\nThere's nothing wrong with my state of mental health.\nI like it here with my childhood friend\nHere they come, those feelings again!\n\nWho can it be now?\nWho can it be now?\nWho can it be now?\nWho can it be now?\n\nIs it the man come to take me away?\nWhy do they follow me?\nIt's not the future that I can see\nIt's just my fantasy\nOh... Who can it be now?\nOh... Who can it... Who can it...\nYeah yeah yeah"
